These scripts automate some very tedious processes in romhack porting.
If a romhack is ported with rm2excoop, skip the first step.

Step 1: Preparing `skyboxes.py`
1. Put `conv_custom_to_not.py` into the `levels` folder.
2. Run `conv_custom_to_not.py`.

Step 2: Using `skyboxes.py`
1. The `levels` and the `textures` folder must be in the same folder as `skyboxes.py`.
2. Such `textures` folder needs a `skyboxes` folder within it.
3. `skyconv.exe` needs to be in either the same folder as `skyboxes.py` or in the `skyboxes` folder.
4. Run `skyboxes.py`.
Optional: If just running skyconv on all of them without moving anything is required, then put `skyconv_all_on_spot.py` and `skyconv.exe` into the `skyboxes` folder. Then just run `skyconv_all_on_spot.py`.

Step 3 (Optional): Using `actors.py`
1. The `actors` folder must be in the same folder as `actors.py`.
2. Run `actors.py`.
Note that this will not do all of the actors successfully, since the method of doing actors that this script uses is known to fail certain actors.
