These scripts automate some very tedious processes in romhack porting.

1. The `levels` and the `textures` folder must be in the same folder as `skyboxes.py`.
2. Such `textures` folder needs a `skyboxes` folder within it.
3. `skyconv.exe` needs to be in either the same folder as `skyboxes.py` or in the `skyboxes` folder.
4. Run `skyboxes.py`.
