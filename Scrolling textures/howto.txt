Put this script into the same directory as the levels folder and the src folder.
The src folder must contain:
    `game` subfolder
    `ScrollTargets.inc.c` within that subfolder.
You can find the src folder in the `output` folder of RM2ExCoop

Note: This assumes all offsets are 0. It will not work on every romhack port. The total count is at the end of each texture. Check this count with the count in script.c and make sure they're both the same.
