Put this script into the same directory as the levels folder and the src folder.
The src folder must contain:
    `game` subfolder
    `ScrollTargets.inc.c` within that subfolder.
You can find the src folder in the `output` folder of RM2ExCoop
The total count is at the end of each texture. Check this count with the count in script.c and make sure they're both the same.

RM2C isn't perfect, and so not all scrolling textures will be properly caught. There may be some missing IDs. These will have to be manually searched for and completed.
